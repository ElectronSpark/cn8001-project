**What is Autopilot?**
```
GKE Autopilot is a mode of operation in GKE in which Google manages your cluster configuration,
including your nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings.
Autopilot clusters are optimized to run most production workloads, and provision compute resources
based on your Kubernetes manifests. The streamlined configuration follows GKE best practices and
recommendations for cluster and workload setup, scalability, and security.
